ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wahabk

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning for the analysis of time series and image data in biosciences.

Iâ€™m currently doing a PhD on Machine Learning at the University of Bristol.

I have experience on softmatter particle tracking and automated segmentation of bone. Have a look at my repositories ðŸ˜„

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting machine learning and data science applications.
